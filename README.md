# Deployed website

## Actual Deployed Site

You can reach my deployed site by cliking on the following link:
[Victor's professional website](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~victor32/VictorPDX/index.html).

## GitHub.io (aka GitHub Pages)

During the testing phase some warnings, due to the naming convention of my files, and the [Matrialize CSS](materializecss.com/) framework caused rendering issues on GitHub pages.
This warnings and issues were not present when my site was deployed on the school server. Please direct yourself to [Victor's professional website](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~victor32/VictorPDX/index.html) and ignore the GitHub.io site.

# Techology Used

In developing my website I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and [Matrialize CSS](materializecss.com/).

# Goals

I tried to make my website accessible, and responsive.

## Accessible

While that was the goal, I do acknowledge there are a few accessibility errors due to contrast.
I made the font larger, and changed the background color, but I was unable to address them.
For that I apologize for any inconvenience that may cause anyone.

## Responsive

I used the [Matrialize CSS](materializecss.com/) framework to help make my site responsive.
I tested for small, medium, and large screens. In writing this I realize I did not bother to consider extra large screens, but if it worked for large I would expect it to work for extra large.

# Project Structure

Originally the index.html was the only html file at the root level, with the other html files under an html directory, however that presented problems during development, and the solution was to have all html files at the same level, bringing all the html files back to the root level or the repo.

# Thank you

Thank you for reading the README in its entirety. I also want to acknowledge my effort in this project and course. Just 10 weeks ago, my webdev skills were not even worth being called a novice. Taking this class and learning from Professor Caterina Paun's lectures have really allowed me to sharpen my skills to be considered an advanced novice. I didn't realize the many technologies available for webdev. With this project conclused my intro to webdev and begins my amature chapter. Thank you.
