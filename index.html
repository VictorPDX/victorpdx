        Hello World!! I am Victor, and this is my personal website. This website
        is all about me. It showcases the work I have done in school, my work
        experience, and how to contact me.

        I am currently a grad student at Portland State Universtity (PSU),
        hoping to finish my degree by the end of August 2021. I am really
        looking forward to the end of the summer term as I will be done with
        school and we are coming out of the pandemic, so things seem to look
        hopeful. To learn more about a particular part of my life use the
        navigation bar above.
