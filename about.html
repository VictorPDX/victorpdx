        I finished High School in 2002 with a GPA of 2.x and tried going back to
        school in 2010. At that time school was not for me, I completed the one
        course and stopped attending. In 2015 I decided to try it one more time,
        this time I stuck with it. I have not had a break since then. I
        completed my B.S. in the Spring of 2020 and expect to complete my M.S by
        the end of August 2021. In my journey here, I have attended Clackamas
        Community College (CCC), Mt. Hood Community College (MHCC), Portland
        Community College (PCC), Oregon Health and Science Universtity (OHSU),
        and of course Portland State Universtity (PSU). During my time at PSU, I
        have been a CS Tutor, a Technical Course Support Specialist (TCSS -
        Undergrad teaching assistant), a Grader, and a grad Teaching Assistant
        (TA). As an undergrad I applied to join MECOP, PCEP, and the PSU Co-op
        internship program. I was rejected from all of them. While it did not
        feel great to be rejected while my fellow peers where getting accepted,
        I continued applying for other internships. I believe that my attitude
        of not staying down, is one of my be biggest strengths and actually
        landed me an internship at Intel. Long story short, I was converted from
        intern to full timer within a year. At work, I work mostly in Python,
        but there is some HTML, CSS, JS, C, Java, and a lot of different
        services we leverage. Taking this class has helped me understand more of
        the way the product I work on. In my studies I have been focusing on
        machine learning, and deep learning, and have not really done any web at
        all. Once I am done with school, my learning will not be ending as there
        is more for me to learn in this realm.
